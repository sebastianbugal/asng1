Testing:
All buttons on the webpage are functional, to test the CSV upload function, create a puzzle and download the CSV file by pressing the download button, once downloaded try and re-upload the CSV file after refreshing the page. The CSV file is simply filled with 1's for
puzzle solution squares and 0 for errors. A new line is used at the end of each 15 character row to indicate the next line. e.g. 
1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n.....(gride size 15*15) if you want to create your own csv please follow the csv guidlines otherwise create the csv on the website reload and test.


All other buttons should work and are responsive and relatively self-explanatory.

Files:
the files in the folder I sent contain lang-logo.png, node.svg, and myapp.html. I am running this on the server created in the tutorial for setting up Heroku therefore, disregard lang-logo and node.svg. all code is contained in myapp.html.
